# LifeGuard

LifeGuard is an innovative wearable health and environmental monitoring system built around the Nicla Sense ME board. The system leverages the board's comprehensive sensor array to monitor ecological conditions, detect physical activities, and identify potential health and safety risks.

By combining advanced motion detection with environmental sensing, LifeGuard provides real-time monitoring and alerts for various safety scenarios, from fall detection to air quality warnings.

## Key Features
- Motion and fall detection
- Physical activity recognition
- Environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, air quality)
- Heart rate monitoring
- Real-time alert system

## Project Structure
The LifeGuard project is organized into the following folders:

- `hardware/`: Contains the PCB design, enclosure files, and other hardware-related assets.
- `firmware/`: Houses the Arduino/C++ code for the Nicla Sense ME board.
- `mobile-app/`: Holds the source code for the React Native mobile application.
- `web-dashboard/`: Contains the React-based web application for data visualization and device management.
- `backend/`: Includes the code for the backend services, either in .NET or Firebase.
- `docs/`: Stores the project documentation, research papers, and other supporting files.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AWESOME04/LifeGuard.git`
2. Set up the development environment:
   - Install Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for the firmware
   - Set up React Native development tools for the mobile app
   - Configure the web dashboard and backend services
3. Refer to the individual README files in each folder for detailed setup and installation instructions.
